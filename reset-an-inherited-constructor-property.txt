function Animal() { }
function Bird() { }

Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);

// Only change code below this line



Bird.prototype.constructor = Bird;
Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;

let duck = new Bird();
let beagle = new Dog();

//The duck and beagle objects have been programmed to inherit the supertypes constructor properties. To overwrite this two lines of code will have to be written to set the constructors to the desired constructors Bird and Dog. The following code demonstrates how this can be achieved.
